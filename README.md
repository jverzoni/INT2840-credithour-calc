Hello!

Before using this please make sure that Python and all of this program's dependencies are installed :)
**OR ELSE** some things may not work as intended. Without python this wont work AT ALL :P

Those dependencies are included in the "requirements.txt" file.
Just run 'python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt' in your IDE terminal with the main folder open and all dependencies will be installed.
